When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  - When collaborating with others
  - When want to work on the same repository from several different devices and locations
  - Keep all my important repositories on the cloud so it won't get lost in case of my local PC breaking down

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So I can get to choose which branch I want to pull
