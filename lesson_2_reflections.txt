What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Will create .git direcotry in the main directory of that project
	Because we need to tell git we need to to version control on that project

	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a intemediate area, which tempararily stores the files that wait to be commited.

	The working directory is a folder that contains project files and repository

	Repository is stored in .git directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	use git diff and git status to make sure all the file is connected to one logical change before you run the commit
